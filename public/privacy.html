   <p class="privacy">CardMe  (“we”, “us” or “our”) aims to make it easy for small merchants to get paid, so that merchants can focus on their own product or service, and customers can get on with using them. As well as easy, we want it to be secure. Should we ask you to provide information by which you can be identified, it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.</p>
   <p class="privacy">We may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy is effective from January 2014.</p>
   <p class="privacy">If you are a Registered User (Merchant), please also review your <a href="http://cardme.co.uk/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> agreement with us. In the case of conflict between these documents, the Terms of Service will be used.</p>
   <p class="privacy">For the duration of pilot scheme, please also review the <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/terms">Terms of Service</a> applicable to your relationship with Stripe, our payments processor.</p>

   <h2 class="privacy-heading">1. What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</h2>
   <p class="privacy">This Policy applies to our website, including all subpages and successor pages (collectively referred to as the “Website”), and also applies to all software and services that we offer, including through our Website when you use our services to receive or make payments  (collectively referred to as the “Services”).</p>
   <p class="privacy">Our website may contain links to websites, products, or services of third-party companies. We do not operate or control these websites, products, or services, and are not responsible for the protection and privacy of information which you provide whilst visiting such sites. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website, product, or service in question.</p>
   <p class="privacy">By using our Website or Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, please delete all cookies from your browser cache after visiting our Website and do not visit or use our Website or Services. Your continued use of our Website or Services will signify your acceptance of this Policy.</p>

   <h2 class="privacy-heading">2. Information collection and use</h2>
   <p class="privacy">We collect information in (1) when you provide it directly to us, (2) when we obtain verification information about you or your company through trusted third parties (e.g. banks, credit bureaus) and (3) passively through technology such as “cookies”. The types of information that we collect and our use of that information will depend on whether you are a Website Visitor, Registered User (Merchant), or a Customer (Payer).</p>
   <h3 class="privacy-heading">Personal Information</h3>
   <p class="privacy">The term “Personal Information”, as used in this Policy, refers to information that can be used to identify a specific person, or anonymous information (e.g. IP Address) that is linked to a specific person. Personal information does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous such that it can no longer be reasonably associated with a specific person.</p>
   <h3 class="privacy-heading">Cookies and Web Server Logs</h3>
   <p class="privacy">Similar to many other commercial websites, we utilize “cookies” and other technologies to collect non-personally-identifiable information from our Website.</p>
   <p class="privacy">A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.</p>
   <p class="privacy">We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our Website and Services in order to tailor them to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.</p>
   <p class="privacy">You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. This may limit your ability to use our Website and Services.</p>
   <h3 class="privacy-heading">Website Visitors</h3>
   <p class="privacy">To simply browse our Website, you are not required to provide any Personal Information. However, we may gather non-personally-identifiable information, as described directly above, solely for the purposes of monitoring and improving our Website and Services. We will not share this information with third parties or use it to target any advertisements to you.</p>
   <h3 class="privacy-heading">Registered Users (Merchants)</h3>
   <p class="privacy">To gain full access to our Website and Services, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, we collect Personal Information when you voluntarily provide it to us, such as the following:</p>

      <li><p class="privacy">Your name, company name, location, email address, and phone number, and account password, to set up your account</p></li>
      <li><p class="privacy">Your business and personal tax, social insurance, or other government-issued identification numbers, as well as your date of birth, to verify your identity for underwriting purposes.</p></li>
      <li><p class="privacy">Your bank account information, to settle funds for your transactions</p></li>
      <li><p class="privacy">Your IP addresses, devices, and locations used to access Stripe, which will be linked to your account for fraud detection/prevention purposes</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p class="privacy">We may retrieve additional Personal Information about you from third parties and other identification / verification services such as credit bureaus. In addition, with your consent, we may collect additional Personal Information in other ways including emails, surveys, and other forms of communication. Once you begin using the Service through your account, we will keep records of your transactions and collect information of your other activities related to our Services.</p>
   <h3 class="privacy-heading">Customers (Payers)</h3>
   <p class="privacy">When members of the public use our services to make payments, we collect information voluntarily provided to us, such as:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><p class="privacy">Your email address and / or social media contact IDs, which we use to establish communications between us, you and your merchant.</p></li>
      <li><p class="privacy">Your card details or bank account information, to provide funds for your transactions.</p></li>
      <li><p class="privacy">Your IP addresses, devices, and locations used to access our services, which will be linked to your account for fraud detection/prevention purposes.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <h3 class="privacy-heading">Use by Children</h3>
   <p class="privacy">Our Website and Services are directed to the general public. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age or have any reasonable grounds for believing that children under the age of 13 are accessing our Website or using our Services. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us.</p>

   <h2 class="privacy-heading">3. Sharing and disclosure of information</h2>
   <p class="privacy">We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to marketers or third parties.</p>
   <p class="privacy">We may share your Personal Information with trusted third parties who are integral to the operation of our Website and Services, including but not limited to financial institutions, payment processors, verification services and credit bureaus, as well as any third parties that you have directly authorized to receive your Personal Information. We may store your Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of Stripe, for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers.</p>
   <p class="privacy">We may disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties if: (i) we are compelled to do so by subpoena, court order or other legal process, (ii) we must do so to comply with laws, statutes, rules or regulations, including credit card rules, (iii) we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our Terms of Service.</p>
   <p class="privacy">We may receive a subpoena or a request from a court, law-enforcement agency or other government body that seeks disclosure of your Personal Information. We will only disclose your Personal Information in response to such a request if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary to comply with applicable law or a legal obligation to which we are bound. If we receive such a request, we will use reasonable efforts to give you prompt notice, so that you may contest it if you choose. We won’t provide you such notice if we determine in good faith that either (a) we are not permitted to provide it under applicable law, or (b) that doing so would result in an imminent risk of death, serious physical injury or significant property loss or damage to Stripe or a third party.</p>
   <p class="privacy">In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar events, certain information in our possession may be transferred to our successor entity.</p>
      
   <h2 class="privacy-heading">4. Choice and opt-out</h2>
   <p class="privacy">You can elect to not provide Personal Information, but this may limit your ability to use our Services. You can update your account information by signing on to our Website.</p>
   <p class="privacy">You can opt out of having your Personal Information used for purposes not directly related to our Services at the point where we ask for such information. You can also opt out of email communications by replying with unsubscribe in the subject line, or via an unsubscribe link included in such communications.</p>
   <p class="privacy">If you wish to opt out of having cookies set on your browser (as described above), you will need to manage the settings on your web browser to delete all cookies and disallow further acceptance of cookies. For more information, refer to your browser's technical information. This may also disable many of the features available through our Websites and Services, so we therefore recommend that you leave cookies enabled.</p>
   <p class="privacy">You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. A small fee will be payable. If you would like a copy of the information held on you please TODO contact us. If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please email us as soon as possible. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.</p>

   <h2 class="privacy-heading">5. Protection of information</h2>
   <p class="privacy">Although no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we take reasonable steps to protect all Personal Information. We maintain strict procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and software systems) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard the account registration process and sign-up information, and the transmission of payment data. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, and firewalls.</p>
   <h2 class="privacy-heading">6. Changes and notifications</h2>
